           I took an interest in software engineering solely through the idea that you can create things with code. I attended Hack Reactor, an advanced software engineering
           immersive, where I honed not only my technical skills in JavaScript, Node, React, and Express, but also my non-technical communication skills through white
           boarding and pair-programming. Moving forward, I'd like to keep developing my software engineering skills even further in order to create more impactful and
           fulfilling projects.</p>
